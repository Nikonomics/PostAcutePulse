## Pending Ideas

### #1 - Skilled Days Methodology Calibration
**Added:** 2025-01-05 | **Priority:** Medium | **Category:** Methodology

Current 1.6x multiplier/23-day LOS produces 12% ST share vs industry ~30%. Test higher multipliers (3-4x) and facility-type specific LOS.

**Notes:**
- Right now we are just using PPR but if we could get information on the MA penetration in a market as well as the total MCR skilled nursing facility spend, we could get a closer estimate
